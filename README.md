### Usage

Here is a simple example of Encrypting & Decrypting 'Do not go gentle into that good night' by Dylan Thomas:

```python
from otp import encrypt, decrypt

text = '''Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'''

ciphertext, pad = encrypt(text)

decrypt(ciphertext, pad)
```

## Development-Contribution guide



### Installing development dependencies

There are a few dependencies you will need to use this package fully, they are specified in the extras require parameter in setup.py but you can install them manually:

```
pytest 	# Used to run the test code in the tests directory
pdoc3   # Used to generate API documentation
```

Just go through and run ```pip install <name>``` or ```sudo pip3 install <name>```. These dependencies will help you to automate documentation creation, testing, and build + distribution (through PyPi) automation.



### Building Documentation

To view the current documentation site you can run ```pdoc otp --http localhost:8080``` and then view it in the browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). To actually **build** the documentation you can use ```pdoc otp --html```.
