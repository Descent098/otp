"""Used to generate 🙊 one-time pads 🤐 exclusively in emojis.

Also has functions for 🔒'ing and 🔓'ing text with the one time pads. The
module exposes both an API and entrypoint. API documentation begins after the
entrypoint usage information.


🖥️Script Usage
--------------
The usage POSIX string for the otp script:
```
Usage:
    otp [-h] [-v]
    otp encrypt <text> [-s] [-o OUTPUT_PATH] [-p PAD_PATH]
    otp decrypt <ciphertext> <pad> [-s] [-o OUTPUT_PATH]


Options:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-v, --version         show program's version number and exit
-o OUTPUT_PATH, --output OUTPUT_PATH
                      custom directory of where to write 
                      pad/plaintext/ciphertext output
-p PAD_PATH, --pad PAD_PATH
                      allows you to specify a pre-created one time pad
-s, --stream          print result to output stream (stdout)
```

So for example you could run ```otp encrypt secret_text.txt``` which will create
a ciphertext and pad of the contents of secret_text.txt and output them to the current
directory as ```pad.txt``` and ```ciphertext.txt``` respectively. You could then run
```otp decrypt ciphertext.txt pad.txt``` which would decrypt the message and send the
output to the current directory as ```plaintext.txt```.

📦Variables
------------
chipher_chars : (list)
    The list of emojis useable for creating one time pads

usage : (str)
    The POSIX usage string that drives docopt for the ``otp`` script

📝Notes
--------
- 🚫 DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION 🚫 I created this project to help better
    understand my security course in 🏫.

- No I will not put this on PyPi, again I put minimal effort into this and it's
    better for it to remain a dissapointment to me than the python community as a whole.

- When opening a text file with the api make sure to pass the encoding parameter to open()
    as 'UTF-8' otherwise there will be an error when the charmaps are read. i.e. 
```
with open('pad.txt', encoding='utf-8') as pad_file:
    pad = pad_file.read()
```

Encrypting 'Do not go gentle into that good night' by Dylan Thomas

```
from otp import encrypt, decrypt

text = '''Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'''
